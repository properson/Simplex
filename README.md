# Simplex
A customizable interaction system for Roblox games

## Description

Simplex is an easy-to-use interaction system. The way it works is inspired from Jailbreak, which also has a fluent interaction system. Simplex doesn't just make doors open and close, it can also manage an "enter vehicle" system, robbing system, and so much more!

## Notice

This project is in its early stages and may be suspectible to breaking at any time. I have applied many "monkey patches" to fix these types of issues. To report a bug/glitch, use the Issues tab on this repository, or the DevForum post. Have fun creating your game!
